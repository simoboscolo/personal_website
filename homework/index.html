			<h1>to Rome, by bike</h1>
			<p class="text">Never taught i was going to do it, but eventually when my friends asked me: "hey wanna come by bike to Rome this summer?" i answered "yeah, why not?". Well, Spoiler Alert: We did it. No preparation at all, 700 km, 12 days and a bit too much money later we were eating spaghetti cacio e pepe. Totally worth it.

					<p class="clear">Step 1: take the bike. Step 2: bike. It sounded easy and honestly the first day was not quite chill. Eventually we learned it's important to have water with you at all times because apparently it's impossible to get it when you're biking in the middle of nothing in the Italian Countryside.</p>
					<p>We also learned you can't bike on sand so there was a lot of walking and Google Maps became our best friend. The sand was ending 'over there' every five minutes, only that it was actually not.</p>
					<p>On top of it a little extra shortcut made our first day something like 10km longer. Lesson number 3 is do not shortcut.</p>
					<p>We arrived at Orio Litta around Dinner time and, as we contacted the major during the day, we stayed at the town hall for the night. Lucky thing is, there was a small city fair, so we relaxed with a beer and funky live music in the evening.</p>

				<h2>Sant'Andrea Terme - 100km</h2>

				<div class="scroll">
					<p class="clear">The Second day was fun! We started biking early in the morning and soon realized the Po Valley was over. We were going up!</p>
					<p>At the first decent city we stop to have a look around and here we meet Susan. We met her at our first night, she was staying at the city hall as well. She was like us travelling. She was from New Zeland and alike us she had so much energy i don't even know how to decribe it! She explained us she started walking from Spain and then went up to North Cape and then came down to Italy and after reaching Rome she was going to go back up and then to Jerusalem. All Walking. She started 2 years before and as we met her in 2013 I guess she should be in the Holy Land about now?</p>
					<p>She played for us a beatiful song with the flute and then she was off again walking. I still don't know where she was getting the energy from.</p>
					<p>After lunch we started biking again going up and up, legs hurting. As a reward we decided to stop for the night in a small thermal village, in a nice resort. We had some good food, loads of it, enjoying music.</p>

				<h2>Cassio - 30km</h2>
				<p class="back" id="dayThreeHide">CLOSE</p>
				<div class="scroll">
					<p class="clear">We had no idea what we were going into! The Po Valley was now really fucking over and we where dying climbing up mountains we didn't even know existed.</p>
					<p>So basically i was the only one stubborn enough to keep biking, because every ten minutes i woudl turn my head and realized i was alone. So i would wait for other ten minutes under the burning sun of July and see the first of my friends coming. The second one was not even trying to bike so we would have to wait ten minutes more for him. After twenty minutes waiting then i would start bike. And the second friend would start shouting at me as he didn't have time to relax. From what i don't know because he was basically walkung carrying a bycicle but ok, let's wait ten minutes more.</p>
					<p>And that's how we managed to do only 30km in one day.</p>

				<div class="scroll">
					<p class="clear">Woke up early knowing we still had 15 km to go till the end of the mountain. We stopped for a quick break in a small town on the way and then up again.</p>
					<p>After we reached the top we started to go down! so fast! At some point we were going 60km per hour and the slowest friend got scared and started going slow again</p>
					<p>At the first Town we stop ad decide was time to relax and have a look around, was very very nice.</p>

				<h2>Pietrasanta - 98km</h2>
				<p class="back" id="dayFiveHide">CLOSE</p>
				<div class="scroll">
					<p class="clear">We woke up relaxed knowing no mountains where ahead us and we were just going down and down to the sea.</p>
					<p>Because we couldn't have a normal day we took the wrong turn and eventually ended up biking in a freeway full of cars trying to defeat us. It was kind of stressfull because there was no way back and many galleries between the hills. Fortunately was not a long way until the next exit.</p>
					<p>The rest of the day was very nice biking shouting: "Hey look! i can see the sea!".</p>
					<p>Arrived there we stayed in a monastery for the night, was amazing, we got our private kind of shed, locked the bike and went for a walk to the beach and around the town. Nice shawarma for dinner.</p>
					<p>Back to our shed/room in the night we find tons of weird insects waiting for us. Not the best sleep ever, but could have been worst.</p>

				<div class="scroll">
					<p class="clear">Surprise surpirse! More mountains!</p>
					<p>Luckily was not much but seeing it completely destroyed our moods so after passing hell we decide to stop in Lucca, which is actually a very very nice city.</p>
					<p>It's completely sourrounded from amazing walls, and you can sit on top of them, so we got a pizza to go and just sat there lookig at the sunset and playing cards.</p>

				<h2>Siena - 100km</h2>
				<p class="back" id="daySevenHide">CLOSE</p>
				<div class="scroll">
					<p class="clear">Oh god, we where not ready for this trip. At all!</p>
					<p>Was definetly not the best day. We woke up early as usual and started to bike following our navigator. If my phone was not saying it was around 35 degrees i would have sayed it was at least 50. Super warm!</p>
					<p>I will rember this day as a turning point, we really were biking in the middle of nothing and it was getting really stressful. We had a huge fight for like an hour where one of my friends wanted to take a train home and the other one was just like wathever. In the end I conviced them the best part was yet to come (i had no idea actually) and next city we could have stopped one night extra just to chill and recharge.</p>
					<p>We arrived at Siena late in the afternoon and booked at a nice hotel just out of the city. Showarma dinner, briscola and bye bye.</p>
